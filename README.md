## Portfolio

This is a showcase of me!

The code isn't anything to scream about. I just wanted to do something a bit different with this application.

So I decided to create art after having a conversation with my good friend and mentor! I created art that interests me and will show my tech stack.

They say a picture paints a thousand words.

Well, this isn't just a picture, but a picture that's animated. There are 36 frames.

So 36 frames x 1000 words = 36,000 words.

Therefore you can say I have 36,000 words worth of content...But to spare you from reading 36,000 words, you can look at art instead...You're welcome!

You can see the website and artwork live at [https://www.nimzys-dev-portfolio.co.uk/](https://www.nimzys-dev-portfolio.co.uk/)
